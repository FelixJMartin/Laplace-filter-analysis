### Task 1 ‚Äî Transfer function (impedance method)

Replaced components with Laplace impedances $Z_R=R$, $Z_C=\tfrac{1}{sC}$, solved for $H(s)=\tfrac{V_{\text{out}}(s)}{V_{\text{in}}(s)}$; sanity-checked $H(0)$ and $\lim_{s\to\infty}H(s)$.


### Task 2 ‚Äî Step Response

**Analytical:** Derived the step response from \(Y(s) = H(s)/s\) using inverse Laplace.  
**Plot:** Implemented and visualized the closed-form solution in Python (Matplotlib).  
**Verification:** Compared with SciPy‚Äôs `signal.step`; results matched well.  

### Task 3 ‚Äî Bode Plot

**Computation:** Generated amplitude and phase diagrams of the filter using Python (SciPy/Matplotlib).  
**Analysis:** By visual inspection, the response shows low attenuation at low frequencies and strong attenuation at high frequencies.  
**Conclusion:** The filter is identified as a **low-pass filter**.

### Task 4 ‚Äî Square Wave Input

**a. Fourier series:** Expanded the periodic square wave (0‚Äì1 V, period T‚ÇÄ) into its sine components using standard Fourier series.  
**b. Table:** Constructed a table for the first five nonzero terms with columns: input signal, frequency, gain, phase shift, and output signal.  
**Computation:** Gains and phase shifts were obtained from the frequency response (verified both via Bode plot and manual FRF calculation).  
**Result:** The table shows how the filter attenuates and phase-shifts each harmonic, illustrating the output as the filtered sum of harmonics.  

### Task 5 ‚Äî Simulation Verification

**Method:** Implemented the filter circuit in a graphical simulator (LTspice / CircuitLab).  
**Comparison:** Simulated step response and Bode plot against analytical and numerical results from Tasks 3‚Äì4.  
**Result:** Simulation confirmed the earlier calculations, validating both amplitude/phase behavior and square wave output.
